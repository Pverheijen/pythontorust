# Rust in the Python Ecosystem

Rust is making waves in the Python ecosystem, especially in performance-critical libraries. These articles will explore how Rust is used to supercharge Python libraries.

## 1. Ruff - The Rust-Powered Python Linter
**Rust Learning**: Building performance-critical tools  
**Python Concept**: Python linters (e.g., flake8, pylint)  
- Ruff is a fast, Rust-powered linter for Python, designed to catch common coding mistakes and enforce style.  
- Compare Ruff's performance benefits due to its Rust core against Python-native linters like `flake8` or `pylint`.  
- Highlight how Rust enables the development of faster, more efficient tools for Python developers, improving the dev workflow without sacrificing Python’s flexibility.

## 2. Polars
**Rust’s Role**: Polars is a DataFrame library, written in Rust, designed for high-performance data manipulation.  
- Compare the performance and design philosophy of Polars with Python's Pandas.

## 3. HuggingFace Tokenizer
**Rust’s Role**: Hugging Face’s Tokenizers library leverages Rust for its blazing-fast performance.  
- Explain how Rust's performance-critical sections improve text tokenization tasks, allowing Python APIs to handle huge NLP datasets efficiently.
