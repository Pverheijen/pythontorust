# UV: The Future of Python Package Management, Powered by Rust

Managing Python projects and dependencies is about to get a lot faster and more efficient with **UV**, a new Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. Designed as a drop-in replacement for tools like `pip` and `pip-tools`, UV is part of a broader effort to create a "Cargo for Python"—a fast, reliable, and comprehensive solution for Python project management.

### What Makes UV Special?

UV dramatically improves the speed of installing and resolving Python packages by leveraging Rust's performance benefits. Unlike traditional tools like `pip`, UV automatically manages Python environments, resolves dependencies, and installs packages without needing extensive manual intervention. Its declarative approach to dependency management ensures that projects remain consistent across machines, and it eliminates much of the hassle that comes with managing virtual environments.

### Key Features Include:

- **Blazing Fast**: UV's Rust-based core is designed to handle dependency resolution and installation much faster than existing Python-native tools.
- **Automatic Environment Management**: UV isolates environments on-demand, meaning you don’t have to manually manage virtual environments.
- **Flexible and Cross-Pl

#### A Drop-in Compatible API

This initial release centers on what is referred to as UV's **pip API**. It'll be familiar to those that have used `pip` and `pip-tools` in the past:

- Instead of `pip install`, run `uv pip install` to install Python dependencies from the command line, a requirements file, or a `pyproject.toml`.
- Instead of `pip-compile`, run `uv pip compile` to generate a locked `requirements.txt`.
- Instead of `pip-sync`, run `uv pip sync` to sync a virtual environment with a locked `requirements.txt`.

### New Capabilities

UV introduces new capabilities that extend beyond traditional Python package management tools. For example:

- **Alternate Resolution Strategies**: By default, UV follows the standard Python dependency resolution strategy of preferring the latest compatible version of each package. However, by passing `--resolution=lowest`, library authors can test their packages against the lowest-compatible version of their dependencies. (This is similar to Go's Minimal Version Selection.)

- **Resolution for Arbitrary Python Versions**: While `pip` and `pip-tools` always resolve dependencies against the currently-installed Python version (e.g., generating a Python 3.12-compatible resolution when running under Python 3.12), UV introduces the `--python-version` parameter. This allows you to generate, for example, Python 3.7-compatible resolutions even when running under newer versions.

- **Dependency “Overrides”**: UV enhances pip’s “constraints” functionality via **overrides** (`-o overrides.txt`), which allow users to guide the resolver by overriding the declared dependencies of a package. Overrides give users an escape hatch for working around erroneous upper bounds and other incorrectly-declared dependencies.

### A "Cargo for Python": UV and Rye

UV represents an intermediary milestone in our pursuit of a **"Cargo for Python"**: a unified Python package and project manager that is extremely fast, reliable, and easy to use.

Think of it as a single binary that bootstraps your Python installation and gives you everything you need to be productive with Python, bundling not only `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv`, but also `pipx`, `tox`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `ruff`, and more.
