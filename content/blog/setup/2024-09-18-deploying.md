# Deployment

For my previous personal website, [peterverheijen.nl](http://peterverheijen.nl), I used an S3 bucket to deploy my Hugo-based blog. This time, I’m interested in exploring other popular deployment options, such as Netlify and Vercel. However, after reading [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/vercel/discussions/3181), it appears there are some current issues with Vercel. Therefore, I’ll be giving Netlify a try instead.

## Netlify
